# BitBurner corrupted scripts

## What is BitBurner?

## Getting Started

- `npm run update` to update BitBurner definition files
- `npm run build` to build the scripts once
- `npm run dev` to start building the scripts on sources changes

## Extension Recommendations

There is a workspace file in `.vscode` which contains the recommended settings for all of these:

- [vscode-bitburner-connector](https://github.com/hexnaught/vscode-bitburner-connector) ([vscode extension marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hexnaught.vscode-bitburner-connector)) to upload your files into the game
- [auto-snippet](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.auto-snippet) to automate inserting the file template in `.vscode/snippets.code-snippets`
